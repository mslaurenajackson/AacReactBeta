Welcome!

This project is a React.js prototype of an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device, inspired by my grandmother, who suffered a grand mal stroke. As a speech-language pathologist (SLP), I was motivated to design a symbol board using Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) principles to support individuals with speech and communication challenges.

ðŸ§  Purpose
To create a digital AAC tool that offers voice output when a symbol or letter is touched, auditory output via synthesized voice, and a customizable communication interface.

ðŸŽ¨ Design
A Figma design prototype is available here:
AAC Prototype Design in Figma - original design features drag and drop symbols

ðŸ§° Technologies Used
React JS â€“ Front-end framework
React Router DOM â€“ For page navigation and routing
Bootstrap â€“ Used for grid layout and responsive styling
Howler.js / VoiceRSS API â€“ For speech synthesis (text-to-speech)
Custom CSS â€“ For theming and styling symbol buttons and interaction areas

ðŸ”‘ Key Features
Click to speak features: User can touch a letter or symbol for it to synthesize speech

Speech Synthesis: Plays audio for selected letters, pictures, videos, or full messages

Navigation Bar (Navbar): User can access different boards

Reusable CSS Classes: Applied across components to maintain visual consistency

Browser Routing: Seamless navigation using <Routes> and <Link> components
