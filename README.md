Welcome!

This project is a React.js prototype of an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device, inspired by my grandmother, who suffered a grand mal stroke. As a speech-language pathologist (SLP), I was motivated to design a symbol board using Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) principles to support individuals with speech and communication challenges.

ðŸ§  Purpose
To create a digital AAC tool that offers voice output when a symbol or letter is touched, auditory output via synthesized voice, and a customizable communication interface.

ðŸ“– User Stories

- As a speech-language pathologist, I want to create customizable symbol boards so that I can tailor AAC tools to clients in need.
- As a child user, I want to tap a symbol and hear a voice output so that I can communicate effectively and code switch between SAE and Gullah dialect.
- As an adult with paralysis, I want to easily use a keyboard so that I can participate in daily living activities.


ðŸŽ¨ Design
A Figma design prototype is available here:
AAC Prototype Design in Figma - original design features drag and drop symbols

ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- React JS (frontend)
- Bootstrap (styling)
- Supabase (authentication & Postgres database)
- React Router DOM (navigation)
- Howler.js / VoiceRSS API (speech synthesis)
- Custom CSS


ðŸ”‘ Key Features
Click to speak features: User can touch a letter or symbol for it to synthesize speech

Speech Synthesis: Plays audio for selected letters, pictures, videos, or full messages

Navigation Bar (Navbar): User can access different boards

Reusable CSS Classes: Applied across components to maintain visual consistency

Browser Routing: Seamless navigation using <Routes> and <Link> components
